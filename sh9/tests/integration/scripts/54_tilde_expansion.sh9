# Test 54: Tilde Expansion (~)
# Tests: ~ expands to $HOME, ~/path expands to $HOME/path, quoted ~ stays literal

# Set HOME explicitly for deterministic output
HOME=/test/home

# Test bare tilde
echo ~

# Test tilde with path
echo ~/subdir

# Test quoted tilde (should NOT expand)
echo "~"

# Test tilde in variable assignment
x=~
echo $x

# Test tilde in middle of word (should NOT expand)
echo prefix~suffix

# Test tilde in double quotes (should NOT expand)
echo "~/quoted"
