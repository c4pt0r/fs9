# Test 07: Loops
# Tests: for loops, while loops, break, continue

# Basic for loop
for i in 1 2 3; do
    echo "num: $i"
done

# For loop with variable expansion
items="apple banana cherry"
for item in $items; do
    echo "fruit: $item"
done

# For loop with command substitution (simulated)
for x in a b c; do
    echo "letter: $x"
done

# Loop with arithmetic
sum=0
for n in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    sum=$((sum + n))
done
echo "sum: $sum"

# Break statement
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        break
    fi
    echo "before break: $i"
done
echo "after break"

# Continue statement
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo "with continue: $i"
done

# Nested loops
for i in 1 2; do
    for j in a b; do
        echo "$i$j"
    done
done

# While loop
count=1
while [ $count -le 3 ]; do
    echo "while: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
